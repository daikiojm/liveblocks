This changelog lists all additions and updates to the Liveblocks API, in
chronological order.

## November 7, 2022

We can now delete a room and its storage by calling our new REST API:

<EndpointBlock
  method="DELETE"
  endpoint="https://api.liveblocks.io/v2/rooms/{roomId}"
/>

This comes in addition to our existing set of endpoints that allow you to manage
rooms (listing, creation, metadata).
