## Why we built a Devtool

Our customers turn to us to expedite the creation of collaborative online
experiences. Leveraging Liveblocks APIs is powerful, but because we handle the
resolution and storage of data structures, understanding what is happening
behind the scenes can be confusing for a new user.

The hope in creating the Liveblocks DevTools was to empower our community so
that beginners can easily understand and learn Liveblocks. At the same time,
power users can leverage the tool to troubleshoot, debug, and optimize their
implementation.

## How the DevTools works

Our DevTools panel is a React + Tailwind app that we can run in the dev tools
extension tab. We built a basic handshake and state synchronization protocol
using browser extension message tunneling and making the `@liveblocks/core`
project aware of it in dev mode. It supports one-way data syncs from the
Liveblocks client. Much like React and Redux Devtools, the code is compiled away
in production.

## DevTools installation

[Our DevTools](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/liveblocks-devtools/iiagocfmmhknpdalddkbiejnfmbmlffk?hl=en)
is available from the chrome web store. You can download it from the store, or
search for it on the main landing page. It is compatible with Chrome and
Firefox.

## Testing the DevTools with a Liveblocks example

All of our examples hosted on Liveblocks.io are available for you to run locally
from the [Liveblocks repository](https://github.com/liveblocks/liveblocks) under
the examples directory.

For the purpose of testing and reviewing how to use the DevTools we will use the
[Advanced Collaborative Spreadsheet](https://liveblocks.io/examples/collaborative-spreadsheet-advanced/nextjs).

After cloning the GitHub repository and navigating to the right example folder:

```
git clone https://github.com/liveblocks/liveblocks.git

cd example/nextjs-nextjs-spreadsheet-advanced/
```

We will need to install packages and create an `.env.local` file, just like we
would do if we were working on the main repository. First, run
`bash npm install` and then create the `.env.local` file with your
`LIVEBLOCKS_SECRET_KEY`

Now we can run our example by running `npm run dev` and navigating to
`http://localhost:3000`
