## What are Liveblocks DevTools?

Our DevTools are a browser based extension that integrates with Liveblocks and
your local development environment. They communicate with Liveblocks servers in
development mode and retrieve the current state of storage and presence. We
created Liveblocks DevTools to empower our community by making it easier for
beginners to understand and learn Liveblocks. At the same time, power users can
leverage the tool to troubleshoot, debug, and optimize their implementation.

## How DevTools works

Our DevTools extension communicates with Liveblocks servers in development mode
and retrieves the current state of storage and presence. This allows you to
easily troubleshoot, debug, and optimize your collaborative online experiences.
We are also working on adding a history feature to the DevTools, which will be
available soon. The DevTools support one-way data syncs from the Liveblocks
client and are compiled away in production, similar to other devtools like React
and Redux Devtools.

Our DevTools are currently only available if you are on Liveblocks .19 or later.
To update required packages, run the following code with your preferred package
manager:

```bash
npm install @liveblocks/client@latest @liveblocks/react@latest
```

## Testing DevTools with a Liveblocks example

All of our examples hosted on Liveblocks.io are available for you to run locally
from the [Liveblocks repository](https://github.com/liveblocks/liveblocks) under
the examples directory.

For the purpose of testing and reviewing how to use DevTools, we will use the
[Advanced Collaborative Spreadsheet](https://liveblocks.io/examples/collaborative-spreadsheet-advanced/nextjs).

After cloning the GitHub repository and navigating to the correct example
folder:

git clone https://github.com/liveblocks/liveblocks.git cd
example/nextjs-nextjs-spreadsheet-advanced/

You will need to install packages and create an `.env.local` file, just like you
would do if you were working on the main repository. First, run `npm install`
and then create the `.env.local` file with your `LIVEBLOCKS_SECRET_KEY`.

Now you can run our example by running `npm run dev` and navigating to
`http://localhost:3000`.
