This changelog lists all additions and updates to the Liveblocks API, in
chronological order.

### November 7th, 2022

We can now delete a room and its storage by calling our new REST API:

<EndpointBlock
  method="DELETE"
  endpoint="https://api.liveblocks.io/v2/rooms/{roomId}"
/>

This comes in addition to our existing set of endpoints that allow you to manage
rooms (listing, creation, metadata).

### September 22nd, 2022

New version of our REST API: `https://api.liveblocks.io/v2` with new
authentication method.

We can now create a new room:

<EndpointBlock method="POST" endpoint="https://api.liveblocks.io/v2/rooms" />

Update a room:

<EndpointBlock
  method="POST"
  endpoint="https://api.liveblocks.io/v2/rooms/{roomId}"
/>

The list rooms has been improved with filtering capabilities on metadata, userId
and groupId:

<EndpointBlock method="GET" endpoint="https://api.liveblocks.io/v2/rooms" />
