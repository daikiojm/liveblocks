With the release of Liveblocks 1.0, we included new pricing plans that are based
on monthly active users (MAU). This guide will help you understand how to use
the new pricing plans by providing guidance on the migration to Liveblocks 1.0
and how to include a `userId` into the `authorize` option if you use it.

## What is a Monthly Active User (MAU) vs. a connection? [#mau-vs-connection]

In versions before 1.0 we used the number of connections to determine pricing
segments. We counted each time a user connected to a Liveblocks room from a
physical device as a connection. While this approximated the number of users, it
did not account for short-lived connections and was sometimes hard to predict.
We introduced pricing based on Monthly Active Users (MAU) to reflect the value
that Liveblocks offers to our customers.

A monthly active user can be defined as:

- Each unique `userId` that connects to a Liveblocks room at least once a month
  (if using authorization)
- Each unique cookie that connects to a Liveblocks room at least once a month
  (if not using authorization)

## How does authorization work with MAU? [#authorization]

In `@liveblocks/node`, we made the field `userId` in the `authroize` option
mandatory. This `userId` is used to track MAU associated with a Liveblocks
account. Each `userId` will count as 1 MAU. To make sure you begin to track MAU
as intended, first update `@liveblocks/node`.

```bash
npm update @liveblocks/node@1.0
```

Then, update your `authorize` option to include the `userId` field.

```ts highlight="16,20"
import { authorize } from "@liveblocks/node";

// Replace this key with your secret key provided at
// https://liveblocks.io/dashboard/projects/{projectId}/apikeys
const secret = "sk_prod_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx";

export default async function auth(req, res) {
  /**
   * Implement your own security here.
   *
   * It's your responsibility to ensure that the caller of this endpoint
   * is a valid user by validating the cookies or authentication headers
   * and that it has access to the requested room.
   */
  const room = req.body.room;
  const response = await authorize({
    room,
    secret,
    // Corresponds to the UserMeta[id] type defined in liveblocks.config.ts
    userId: "123",
    groupIds: ["456"], // Optional
    userInfo: {
      // Optional, corresponds to the UserMeta[info] type defined in liveblocks.config.ts
      name: "Ada Lovelace",
      color: "red",
    },
  });
  return res.status(response.status).end(response.body);
}
```

<Banner title="Using a secret key with authorization">
  To use the `authorize` option, you need your backend endpoint. Your Liveblocks
  dashboard contains the secret key required to use the authorize option.

To learn more about authorization and authentication in your Liveblocks
application, check out our [Authentication Guide](/docs/guides/authentication).

## How is MAU calculated using a public key? [#public-key]

To use Liveblocks 1.0 without authorization, you must update your Liveblocks
packages to 1.0. We will count each connection as one MAU if you do not update
your packages to 1.0. Once the pacakages are updated, a cookie will be set on
the client to track when a new user connects to a room. This cookie will track
MAU associated with a Liveblocks account and expire after 30 days.

Inside the `createClient` function, you will use your public key instead of a
private key.

```ts file="liveblocks.config.ts" highlight="4"
import { createClient } from "@liveblocks/client";

const client = createClient({
  publicApiKey: "pk_prod_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx",
});
```

To illustrate how counting MAU works without a `userId`, consider the following:

If you have one user who connects to a Liveblocks room that does not enforce
authorization, you will be billed for 1 MAU. That same person can reaccess a
room the next day, and MAU would not increase. The cookie will expire at the end
of the 30-day billing cycle, and the user will be counted as a new MAU.
Liveblocks will count that anonymous user as 2 MAU if packages are not updated.

## Development Use [#development-use]

While working in development mode, you will not be billed for MAU. However, you
will still need to include a `userId` in the `authorize` option if you use it.
We are currently working on updating our dashboard to reflect the number of MAU
for development use.

## How to migrate to Liveblocks 1.0 [#migration]

To update to Liveblocks 1.0, you will need to update your Liveblocks packages:

```bash
npm update @liveblocks/node @liveblocks/client @liveblocks/react
```

You will then pick one of the two methods outlined above for tracking MAU:
[authorization](#authorization) or [public](#public-key). After completing these
steps to take advantage of the new pricing model, you should review the
[Liveblocks 1.0 Upgrade Guide](/docs/guides/upgrading/1.0) for additional
details on migrating Liveblocks 1.0.
